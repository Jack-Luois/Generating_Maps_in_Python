In this notebook, we will learn how to create maps for different objectives. To do that, we will work with Python visualization library, namely Folium. What is nice about Folium is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as plotly, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. Folium, on the other hand, is completely free.

We'll generate from simple maps to advance maps such as `Choropleth` maps as shown below.
